== SimpleVis

This is a simple Rails app to visualize geospatial data from a MongoDB database.

It works by creating a dataset, which contains information about where to find the geospatial geojson objects, then query them and display the results on a Leaflet JS map.
Optionally it supports filtering the displayed results by querying the MongoDB collection directly.
